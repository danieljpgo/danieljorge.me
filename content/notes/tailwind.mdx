During a conversation at work, the following sentence was said:

> Tailwind is good but hard to read (…)

## Teste

Initially, I understand where this thought comes from, because with [Tailwind]() and other [Utility First CSS]() solutions, it is possible to have long strings with classes. However, I believe the exact opposite, for me over time, Utility First CSS becomes more readability.

If we agree that composition is the most readable way to build something, Tailwind and Utility First CSS is the composition of css classes to write CSS.

Following this logic, when we analyze different forms of composition and their alternatives, it will become clearer:

### Exemplos de composição - Código

Following this logic, when we analyze different forms of composition and their alternatives...

```tsx title="parse.ts" showLineNumbers /.filter/ /.map/ /.toString/
data.filter(...).map(foo => foo.toString());
```

Following this logic, when we analyze different forms of composition and their alternatives...

```tsx title="parse.ts" showLineNumbers /filterMapToString/
filterMapToString(data);
```

### Exemplos de composição - Componente

Following this logic, when we analyze different forms of composition and their alternatives...

```tsx title="UserProfile.tsx" showLineNumbers {4-6}
{...}
<Card>
  <Card.Title>
    <Heading as="h3" size="lg" weight="medium">
      {user.name}
    </Heading>
  </Card.Title>
  <Card.Content>
    {...}
  </Card.Content>
</Card>
```

Following this logic, when we analyze different forms of composition and their alternatives...

```tsx showLineNumbers /heading="Title"/ title="UserProfile.tsx"
{...}
<Card heading="Title">
  {...}
</Card>
```

Using the same logic as above, we can represent the same composition concept with css.

### Exemplos de composição - Tailwind

Following this logic, when we analyze different forms of composition and their alternatives...

```html showLineNumbers /rounded bg-white p-4 shadow/
<div class="rounded bg-white p-4 shadow">{...}</div>
```

Following this logic, when we analyze different forms of composition and their alternatives...

```html showLineNumbers /card/
<div class="card">{...}</div>
```

## Conclusion

Therefore, I believe that in the end readability is not a problem with Tailwind and I believe that those who like functional programming can see this more easily, but that is a topic for another day.
