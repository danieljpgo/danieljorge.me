I was listening to the [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty) featuring [Kevin Powell](https://twitter.com/kevinJPowell) about [Learning CSS in 2023](https://changelog.com/jsparty/255), where he commented:

> CSS is a set of boundaries, not hard rules

This sentence defines exactly what I've always thought about CSS, we build limits that the interface will follow, not rigid values ​​of how it should be because **we don't control the user's browser** and many times **we don't have control of the displayed content**.

So make your CSS flow, not rigidly defined.
