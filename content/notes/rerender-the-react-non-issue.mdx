Performance is always a concern among developers, often before it's even necessary. However, using [React](https://react.dev), there are still several misunderstandings and one of them, and perhaps the main one is rerenders.

> 100 renders can be faster than 1 slow render.

## The Non-Issue

First, to understand why it's not an issue, we must understand how React rendering happens.

As it is [said in the official documentation](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit), we can separate it into three steps:

- [Trigger](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render)
- [Render](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit#step-2-react-renders-your-components)
- [Commit](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit#step-3-react-commits-changes-to-the-dom)

## Rerender, React's specialty

By design, React was made to generate multiple renders and it was special in the beginning because it managed to do this with good performance and a simple mental model.

That's why it's important not to make premature optimizations, and measure any change made in order to optimize something, to ensure that it's not actually harming.

> You only optimize what you measure
