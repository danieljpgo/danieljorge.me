# 100 rerender rápidos são melhores que 1 rerender lento.

I always see discussions about some things using React are not good because it will generate a lot of re-rendering, but I never understood it right, because re-rendering was never a problem, the real problem was always slow renders.

## ABC

How can you assure me that your improvement to generate fewer renders has not slowed down renders?

Kent C Dotts comments in one of his blogposts about optimization costs:

- [When to useMemo and useCallback
  ](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback)

In the post it is shown that every performance optimization has its costs, and that depending, the initial cost may be worse than it was before, after all the user does not notice several renders, but will notice a slow render.

### ABCD

> 100 renders can be faster than 1 slow render.
> This phrase is a good mental model to have on the subject, always try to optimize slow renders and not necessarily multiplus renders.

But it's important to understand why rerendering might not be a problem.
{/* title="Stack.tsx" */}

```tsx showLineNumbers {2,8}
function Foo() {
  console.log("render: FOO");
  return <div>FOO!</div>;
}
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  console.log("render: Counter");
  return (
    <>
      <Foo />
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>{count}</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### ABCDE

In the example, FOO will be rendered every time the counter is updated, but the DOM will never be updated.

So in the end treat React like something fast right out of the box, don't worry about unnecessary renders and focus on slow renders.

I would like to start by going straight to the point on the topic:
