# 100 rerender rápidos são melhores que 1 rerender lento.

I always see discussions about some things using React are not good because it will generate a lot of re-rendering, but I never understood it right, because re-rendering was never a problem, the real problem was always slow renders.

> You only optimize what you measure

I like to use this phrase above when it comes to improving performance because it is very easy to get the wrong performance metrics, perform optimizations and the end result is worse than it was.

How can you assure me that your improvement to generate fewer renders has not slowed down renders?

Kent C Dotts comments in one of his blogposts about optimization costs:
[When to useMemo and useCallback
](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback)

In the post it is shown that every performance optimization has its costs, and that depending, the initial cost may be worse than it was before, after all the user does not notice several renders, but will notice a slow render.

> 100 renders can be faster than 1 slow render.

This phrase is a good mental model to have on the subject, always try to optimize slow renders and not necessarily multiplus renders.

But it's important to understand why rerendering might not be a problem.

However, first of all, it is important to differentiate between the Render phase and the Commit phase, when we think about re-rendering, we think about updating the DOM, but this only happens during the Commit phase, that is, after rendering and after Reconciliation. The Reconciliation phase is responsible for making comparisons between what is being rendered with the previous rendering and then going to the Commit phase, where the DOM will be updated, if necessary.

That is, there may be renderings that occur, but never updated in the DOM, not generating any performance cost.

In the excellent blogpost by Kent C Dotts, he goes into more detail about the problem:
[Fix the slow render before you fix the re-render](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/fix-the-slow-render-before-you-fix-the-re-render)

And here is the example he uses:

In the example, FOO will be rendered every time the counter is updated, but the DOM will never be updated.

So in the end treat React like something fast right out of the box, don't worry about unnecessary renders and focus on slow renders.
