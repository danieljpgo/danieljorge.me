## Keyboard

Here is my curated list of commands and modifications that I personally use on MacOS to enhance keyboard experience.

### Key Repeat

The key repeat, also known as repeat delay, refers to the time interval between holding down a key and when it starts repeating.

- Default value is 6.

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1
```

Lowering the value increases the response time for faster character input.

### Initial Key Repeat

The repeat rate, also referred to as initial key repeat, determines how quickly a character repeats itself once it starts.

- Default value is 25.

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 12
```

Adjusting this value allows you to customize the speed of character repetition to suit your preferences.
