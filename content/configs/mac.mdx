## Keyboard

{/* Here is my curated list of commands and modifications that I personally use on MacOS to enhance keyboard experience. */}

### Key Repeat

The key repeat, also known as repeat delay, refers to the time interval between holding down a key and when it starts repeating.

Lowering the value increases the response time for faster character input.

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -float 1.5
```

- Default value is `6`.

### Initial Key Repeat

The repeat rate, also referred to as initial key repeat, determines how quickly a character repeats itself once it starts.

Adjusting this value allows you to customize the speed of character repetition to suit your preferences.

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 10
```

- Default value is `25`.

### Key held down behavior

Allows you to select the behavior when a key is held down for a long time. The two possible behaviors are:

- show character accents menu (default)
- repeat character while key held

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults write NSGlobalDomain "ApplePressAndHoldEnabled" -bool "false"
```

- Default value is `true`.

## Dock

### Autohide delay

Remove the autohide delay, the Dock appears instantly

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults write com.apple.dock "autohide-delay" -float "0" && killall Dock
```
