## Remove here

## Faster key repeat rate

{/* ## Faster keyboard response (minimum is 2) */}

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1
```

## Reduced delay until repeat

{/* ## Reduced key repeat delay (minimumis is 15) */}

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 12
```

## Remove dock show/hide delay

First, activate auto-hide in System Preferences → Dock → Autohide

0 is the time it takes for the Dock to appear in seconds. You can choose floats and integers e.g. 2, 0.5,...
killall Dock causes the Dock to restart.

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0; killall Dock
```

Revert

```bash title="Terminal"
defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay; killall Dock
```
